## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee gave me a set of tasks to complete an election audit of a recent local congressional election. The purpose of this project was to inspect a csv file of an election, and utilize Python coding to read the csv file adn organize accordingly the data set to help determine various results from the election. These results included total number of votes casted, a list of the counties and candidates involved, each countie's and candidate's total votes recieved, a percentage of the countie's and candidate's votes, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.
